          WHO WE ARE
        </p>
        <p className=" text-white pb-3 text-2xl">
          Career Advantage is a full-service staffing agency that provides comprehensive
          staffing solutions in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas.  We began in 2001 as a
          two person search firm and have been on a journey of growth since.  After taking stock
          of who we are and where we've been, one thing became clear; maintaining the status quo
          was no way to run a business. We realized to keep growing, we'd have to be infinitely
          more invested. In our own people, clients, and candidates. In everything we do, every
          single day. So we made a commitment to do exactly that. And we've remained true to it ever since.
        </p>

          No matter what position you're looking to fill, you can be confident every candidate we
          present will be more qualified, more skilled and more of what you are looking for. If you're
          looking for work, you can be confident that our clients have highly desirable positions that
          you may not find using typical job search methods.  And that we have the relationships and
          connections to expose you to the industries and positions you want.
